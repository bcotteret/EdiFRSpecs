# Ruby EDIFACT testing Project
I am currently working on a project including processing orders from/to EDIFACT messages.

I have refactored out specs and code libs from the application.

## Setup
Install rvm along with Ruby 2.3.x
Bundle it to get gems installed

## Usage
Simply run *guard* from your terminal.

Guard will then run your specs (and watch for change).

Process files from the messages folder. Output files in the OUT folder
