# Ruby EDIFACT testing Project
I have been working on a project including processing orders from/to EDIFACT messages.
I have refactored out specs and code libs from the application.

## Setup
Install rvm along with Ruby 1.9.3.
Bundle it to get gems installed

## Usage
Simply run guard from your terminal.

Guard will then run your specs.

Process files from the messages folder.
